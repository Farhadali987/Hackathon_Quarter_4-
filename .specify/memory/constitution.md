# Panaversity Hackathon I Constitution

## Core Principles

### Hackathon Requirements Compliance
The project MUST follow all Hackathon I base and bonus requirements without exception.

### Technology Stack Compliance
The project MUST use Docusaurus v3 for the textbook, FastAPI for the backend, and Qdrant Cloud + Neon Postgres for RAG implementation.

### No Hallucinated APIs or Fake Code
The project MUST NOT include hallucinated APIs or fake code. All libraries and APIs used must be real and verifiable.

### Beginner-Friendly but Technically Correct Content
The project MUST be beginner-friendly while maintaining technical accuracy and correctness.

### RAG Content Integrity
The RAG chatbot MUST answer only from indexed content and MUST NOT generate responses beyond the provided knowledge base.

### Urdu Translation Requirements
Urdu translations MUST preserve technical terms while making content accessible to Urdu-speaking users.

### Git History Management
The project MUST maintain clean Git history with meaningful commit messages that clearly describe changes.

## Governance

All development activities must comply with these principles. Changes to this constitution require formal approval and documentation of the rationale. Regular compliance reviews will be conducted to ensure ongoing adherence to these principles.
