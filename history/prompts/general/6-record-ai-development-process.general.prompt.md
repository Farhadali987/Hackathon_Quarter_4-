## Prompt

Record this entire AI-driven development process
as a Prompt History Record for future learning and reuse.

## Response snapshot

I've documented the entire AI-driven development process that included:
1. Analyzing the repository state and identifying changes
2. Creating meaningful commits with detailed messages
3. Pushing changes to the remote repository
4. Preparing a pull request summary
5. Creating PHRs for the workflow

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete documentation of the AI development workflow process
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run as this was a documentation task
- 📁 Files: PHR file created to document the development process
- 🔁 Next prompts: Could use this as reference for future development workflows
- 🧠 Reflection: The process demonstrates a complete workflow from analysis to documentation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Feature-specific PHR creation
